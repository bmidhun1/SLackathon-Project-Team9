## Short description

### What's the problem?

Optimize Supply Chain Inventory
Super Effectively manage and optimize inventory by capturing variables such as lead times, manufac- turing frequency, batch size, and ordering policies from across the supply chain. Using algo- rithms, exception-based forecasts, and real-time downstream demand signals, suggest and adjust inventories to optimal levels. Maintain the right amount of inventory required to meet demand, keep logistics costs low, and avoid common inventory issues such as stockouts, over- stocking, and backorders.

### How can technology help?
Optimize supply chain inventory - Technology to optimize supply chain inventory and to help quickly choose the best manufacturing plants to optimize inventory and minimize cost.

### The idea

Using historical demand data to train a machine learning model, you can predict demand for certain items more accurately in the future, and ensure that your customers are able to purchase what they want. 

Using this predicted demand as input, along with manufacturing plant data such as cost and capacity, this application enables a store manager to quickly choose the best manufacturing plants to optimize inventory and minimize cost.

## The architecture

![Video transcription/translation app](https://developer.ibm.com/developer/tutorials/cfc-starter-kit-speech-to-text-app-example/images/cfc-covid19-remote-education-diagram-2.png)

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.
